Deviation Memo

  Greetings owner of the business, I had to make some business decisions based on the database you originally had us use. We had to use a different database, and the way I implemented this program uses an O(N^2) operation, which isn’t the most efficient, and I’m not sure there is any other way to complete this program. We had to use more than one city from each area, but it should be fine, because the housing units and zip codes all have different stats. It’s not just giving you the same stats for each area code. Also, a silver lining is you can see which area codes have a more precise population.  A down fall is it’s a little clunky and a lot to take in once you start hitting 3-digit numbers in searches. I apologize if everything isn’t to your liking and hope for the best with your new program. I unit tested all of the methods that calculate things and the calculations are in order.

Thank you for your time and willingness to work with me,
Steven P.
