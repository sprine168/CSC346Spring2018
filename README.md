### Deviation Memo

  Greetings owner of the business, I had to make some business decisions based on the database you originally had us use. I had to use a different database, and the way I implemented this program uses an O(N^2) operation, which isn’t efficient. I had to use more than one city from each area, because the housing units and zip codes all have different stats. It’s not just giving you the same stats for each area code. Also, a silver lining is you can see which area codes have a more precise population.  A down fall is it is clunky and a lot to take in once you start hitting 3-digit numbers in searches.

Thank you for your time and willingness to work with me,

Steven P.
